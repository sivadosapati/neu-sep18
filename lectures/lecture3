OOPS
	- Encapsulation
		- Make every data in an object as private
		- Define public <Type> getXXX() for accessing the data
		- Define public void setXXX(<Type> t) for modifying the data
	- Abstraction
		- Focus on what and not on how
		- Invoke behaviors already defined in other objects
		- Define new behaviors that can be discoverable by other objects
	- Reuse
		- Inheritance - Is a - Apple is a Fruit, Dog is an Animal
		- Composition - Has a - Laptop has a Keyboard, iPhone has a camera, Cup has a Handle
	- Polymorphism
		- Static polymorphism - method overloading - same method name, different parameters and same return type
		- Dynamic polymorphism - Have a base class reference point to a child class object
			- At run time, the right method is invoked depending on what the reference is pointing to
