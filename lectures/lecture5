Packages are a way to compartmentalize classes
Every class in a package can access other class in the same package without any import statements
Classes in other package can be accessed through an import xx.yy only if the class is public
Prefer importing the class as against importing the whole package
classes defined in the package should have the name of package defined as the first line and the package should be in a directory
In the situation of a conflict - access the class with a fully qualified package name
By default, java provides java.lang package for every class (this doesn't need to be imported)


Exceptions..

try{} catch{} is a block to handle a piece of code that can potentially throw an exception
Either all the logic in the try or All the logic in the catch or parts of logic in Try and parts of logic in Catch will get executed
Every try{} block can be accompanied with multiple catch blocks
finally{} block is accompanied with a try{} block and the logic in finally block will always get executed irrestive of try or catch
Not every try{} can have catch blocks and try{} should be accompanied with atleast catch or finally or both
Every method should have a throws xxxException, if the logic in the method can throw exception at some point of time using throw new xxException();
A calling method can either handle the exception using try() catch or throw the exception to the invoking method again by throws xxx

Custom Exceptions can be created by subclassing a class named Exception
Custom exception can also have some state in it.

Custom exceptions can extend from RuntimeException
RuntimeException or its children doesn't need to be either caught or defined in the method as throws xxxRuntimeException

Errors are not recoverable and it's a good idea to look at the program and fix the code.
