//Abstract class is a concept where an Object of this class can't be created
//Abstract class can have abstract methods
//If a class has one abstract method - the class needs to be abstract
//Interface is a definition of a contract. A class can implement one or more interfaces
//Object is the base class for all classes
//static variable means every objet of the class will share the state
//static methods means every object of the class invoke through class
//final variables mean the state can't be changed after it is initialized
//final methods can't be overriden in the child classes
//final classes can't be subclassed
//Unit Testing is a way to write tests for every logic and ensure that they are always run and are green
