Collection framework is an abstraction to group of objects
Collection is a base interface for working with a group of objects
Collection has methods like add(), remove(), size(), addAll() etc to access objects
Any type of Collection can shrink or expand based on the access patterns
List is the base interface for group of objects that will add every object in the group (all duplicates and no sorting)
ArrayList is the common type of List - Time complexity (O(1) for accessing an index)
LinkedList is better for removal and expansion of elements
Stack is for Last In First Out (LIFO)
Queue is for First In First Out (FIFO)
Sets are used for storing collection of objects without duplicate
HashSet is for unordered list and LinkedHashSet for ordered list
Every Object put in Set should implement equals() and hashCode()
TreeSet is for organizing objects in sorted order
Every Object put in TreeSet should implement compareTo() method
